### Cache - Space problem

[link](https://discovery.endeavouros.com/articles/root-partition-full-dont-panic-clear-pacmans-cache-first/2020/03/)

When you install a package with Pacman, it stores all downloaded packages in
```
/var/cache/pacman/pkg/ 
```
folder. The package manager doesnâ€™t remove old and uninstalled packages 
automatically by default and after a while, the cache size can consume a 
substantial amount of real estate on your HDD or SDD.
