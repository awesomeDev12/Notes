# COA algorithms

Well there are certain algorithms involving bit manipulation that we need to take care of
Multiplication and booth optimization

Division method 

```
i=0;
for i<32 do
	i=i+1

	//Left shift UV by 1 position
	UV=UV<<1;
	U=U-D

	if U>= 0 then
		q=1;
	end
	else
		U=U+D;
		q=0;
	end

	//Set the quotient last bit 
	LSB of V=q
end

```
