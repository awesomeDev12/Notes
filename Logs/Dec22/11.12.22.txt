We have our CT from Tuesday and I have no clue as to what I'll write in it
Lets see well I think Linux is my best friend. I have a lot to confess to you my dear.
Lets start the world I am living is changing very fast and I dont know what to do It seems to me that coding is extremely difficult and its going to take a lot of time to master it

It takes time to learn touch typiing I hope I'll learn it in 2-3 months I don't know what to do
Now about DBMS there are a few things I should keep in mind.
There is something called a three schema architecture. You see it involves data abstraction.

So basically there are there are three views - External view, Conceptual View and Physical view.
External view is what regular users can see. Conceptual view is based on E-R models or Relational models.

In ER model, there are certain mappings :-
1) One One 
2) One Many
3) Many Many

The interesting thing about these mappings ia that they have to be analyzed so that we can minimize the number of the tables involved by merging primary keys of relationships

Say there are two entities - Employees and Departments 
In the Employees table, the primary key is  Employee id
and in the Departments table, the primary key is Department id
The relationship (also called correspondence) is the Works table
Now, the works table needs only two columns - the primary keys of the Employee and Department tables 
So its two columns are - Eid (Employee id) and Did(Department id)
