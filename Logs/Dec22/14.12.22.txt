14 Dec 22 Wednesday

Well, I appeared for a DSA exam and it didn't go as I had planned. The first two questions were easy - Celebrity Problem and Find Nth node from the end of Linked List.

However, I couldn't solve the 3rd problem - Min Stack.
My mistake was distro hopping and not solving leetcode questions regularly.
BIG MISTAKE!!!must rectify ASAP

Maths exam is scheduled to be held tomorrow. Syllabus is Differential Calculus and Vectors.
Lets see.
First, I'll do DE part2
