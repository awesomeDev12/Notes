I don't know how it happened but we have to appear for a DBMS exam tomorrow.
There was miscommunication between the CRs and the faculty. I will achieve total control over myself.
All great men have done this in the past and I wish to follows there footsteps. Its interesting that VIM is actually a language. Plenty of people believe that we need to respond to this crisis in a mature way.
for how long can we suffer the slings and arrows of fortune. It was the best of times and the worst of times.


Bob woke up in the morning  and realized that he was late for college. It was a chilly winter morning. He wrapped a muffler round his neck and covered himself with a thick jacket. All the buses were full. Commuters glued to there phones. Somehow, he reached college hard to say when. Proffessors were distributing question papers and making sure that no friends sat together. Students were being punished for absurd reasons like feeling happy and chatting with friends. It was a tough time. I must say. I didn't know any answers but I really wanted to pass the exam so I peeped over into my neighbour's copy. I've got no idea how long it lasted but it was painful. All the lashed - FATAL LASHES. "You are in HELL", my brain shouted at me. I didn't know how to react. It was if the whole world is going to fall apart. My eyeballs couldn't move. They were fixed with a pair of hot iron tongs. I couldn't move them a bit. It was extremely painful. I did'nt know what to do. Iwas in a quandary. Well, if you could call it a quandary. I have to recover. I must be strong like the iron.Filled with passion like out freedom fighters.
